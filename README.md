# myPortfolio


This website presents a (partly hypothetical) summary of my work.<br>

The first two projects are completely functional (piet, pablo), the second two are still at the stage of research, and the last (spacerino) is in development but does not yet have a deployment date.<br>

For any inquiries please contact me using the email link provided on the main page.
